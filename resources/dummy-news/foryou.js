    body: 'Polish teenager Iga Swiatek won her country’s first Grand Slam singles title on Saturday as she defeated American fourth seed Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1 to become the youngest women’s French Open champion since 1992.\nThe 19-year-old Swiatek, at 54 the lowest-ranked woman to capture the Roland Garros title in the modern era, is the ninth first-time major champion in the past 14 Grand Slams.\n“It had to be that another underdog won a Grand Slam in women’s tennis. It is so often right now that it is crazy,” said Swiatek, who captured her first tour title in the process.\n“I don’t know what’s going on. It’s overwhelming for me, it’s crazy.\n“Two years ago I won a junior Grand Slam (at Wimbledon) and now I’m here. It feels like such a short time.”'

    title: '‘Rafael Nadal has no chance against Novak Djokovic in these conditions,’ says Serb’s coach',
    source: 'Tennishead',
    body: 'Goran Ivanisevic says Rafael Nadal would have ‘no chance’ against Novak Djokovic in the current conditions at Roland Garros.\nIvanisevic, who coaches Djokovic, believes the Serb has ‘got into Nadal’s head’ and is the big favourite to win the tournament.\nBoth players first have to get through semi-finals, but if they meet in the final, Ivanisevic has gone big on his predictions.\n“I’m counting on Novak – Nadal in the final, in which, in my opinion, Nadal has no chance in these conditions, on this clay and with Novak, who has got into his head,” Ivanisevic told HRT.\n“I went a little too far, but in my opinion Novak is the number one favourite. He brought his body, his head and preparation to perfection.\n“He prepares everything in detail, from tactics, technique, to nutrition, and he adheres to it.\n“That’s the most important thing because I couldn’t stick to half of it.n“But he knows it makes him better, he wants to progress every day and it’s very interesting to work with him because he wants something better every day, at least 0.00001 percent, but something has to be happening.\n“I have never seen such a mentality in my life.”\nRafael Nadal faces Diego Schwartzman in his semi-final with Djokovic drawn against Stefanos Tsitsipas.'

    title: '\'Maybe it\'s the pressure\': Carreno Busta whacks Djokovic for medical time-out',
    source: '9News',
    body: 'Novak Djokovic has overcome a bothersome left arm and early deficit to reach the French Open semi-finals for the 10th time.\nThe top-seeded Djokovic got off to a slow start on the scoreboard before coming back to beat No.17 seed Pablo Carreno Busta 4-6 6-2 6-3 6-4.\nThis was a rematch from the US Open last month when Djokovic was defaulted in the fourth round for hitting a line judge in the throat with a ball he smacked in anger with his racket after dropping a game in the first set.\nThat went into the books as a loss and remains the only blemish on his 36-1 record in 2020.'

    source: 'Domain',
    body: 'He’s faced Roger Federer on the court, but Australian tennis champ and sports commentator Sam Groth swears that buying his Alphington property at auction was “the most nerve-wracking experience ever”.\nNo regrets, though. The enchanting two-storey weatherboard house he and his now-wife, Britt, bought in 2016 after deciding to quit the US circuit for a Melbourne base was the first place they inspected and they instantly loved it.\nNow, after four years of enjoying the suburb where Britt had grown up, they are selling their renovated four-bedroom, two-bathroom house at 56A Fulham Road to move closer to family in Templestowe and to upsize “because you get to the stage where you’re thinking about starting a family”. An on-site tennis court also wouldn’t go astray.\nJellis Craig agent Greg Cusack says the property’s indoor/outdoor entertainment space and the Groths’ stylish upgrade are luring young families and professional couples to register for the twilight auction on October 28.'
