    body: 'Researchers in Western Australia are leading the fight to understand why young, healthy patients who don\'t have any of the usual warning signs are still getting very sick and dying from COVID-19 while others in their cohort are barely affected.\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) data has found about 80 per cent of people recovered from COVID-19 without special treatment.\nBut on a recent WHO mission to assess the situation in China, epidemiologist Bruce Aylward said the health staff could not work out why certain patients crashed.'

    source: 'The Guardian',
    body: 'An unexploded 45kg bomb has been towed into deep waters five months after being found off the New South Wales coast.\nThe weapon was found in late April by a fisherman on Lord Howe Island’s Elizabeth Reef. Defence personnel said it could have posed “a significant risk to the general public”.\nThe local angler was visiting the reef, about 550km off the coast of NSW, with his wife and photographed his discovery and reported it to authorities.\nNavy divers aboard HMAS Adelaide carefully removed the abandoned explosive on 25 September by floating it to the surface and towing it further out to sea where it was dropped into 550-metre-deep waters.'
