    body: 'BANGKOK -- At least 17 people died early Sunday when a train collided with a bus in central Thailand, officials said.\nThe tour bus was traveling with 65 passengers on board when it crossed the railway track during rain in Chacheongsao, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Bangkok, where a train smashed into the vehicle.\nPrathueng Yookassem, the district chief officer, told Thailand\'s PBS TV that at least 17 people died and 30 were injured.\n“It was raining, perhaps, the driver did not see the train,” he said.\nAll of the injured were brought to two hospitals. Police say they are investigating.\nThe bus passengers were traveling from Samut Prakan province to a Buddhist temple in Chachoengsao for a merit-making ceremony.'

    title: 'China is doubling down in the global push for a coronavirus vaccine',
    source: 'CNN',
    body: '(CNN)The global push to develop a coronavirus vaccine is gathering pace, but much to the likely frustration of US President Donald Trump, caution exercised by American drug makers and regulators has put China out in front ... for now.\nModerna, a leading coronavirus vaccine maker, said this month it will not be ready to apply for emergency use authorization until at least November 25. Meanwhile, the US-based trial sites of another frontrunner, AstraZeneca, have placed testing on hold after a participant in Britain developed a serious illness last month, further undermining Trump\'s hopes that a vaccine would be ready in time for Election Day on November 3.\nThe stringent US safety protocols have shifted the so-called vaccine race in China\'s favor, where -- for better or worse -- political will holds a much larger sway over state, commercial and individual actions, potentially bending rules or norms as needed.\nChina\'s leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly urged the country\'s scientists to accelerate the research and development of coronavirus vaccines. Chinese drug makers have also been told to treat their work as an "important political task" -- and they are doing everything they can to follow that directive.'
