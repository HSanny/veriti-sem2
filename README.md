## Project Overview

### Analysis of problem space
In order to understand the problem, what the client wants our of the project and how we might serve them in that goal, our team has done a simpleanalysis of the problem space. This analaysis served as a basis for our Statement of Work and will give us a solid grounding in the project space going forward.

### Statement of Work
An SoW was produced by the team with Tina authoring, Dingyi and Lingyu providing technical advice. The client was consulted in an iterative approach with 2 rounds of feedback being taken before the final acceptance by our Client.

### Client Meeting
At our initial client meeting, we queried them about their business goals, talked about the problem space and their perspectives on the problem they have commissioned us to solve. We discussed expectations of our team going forwards, short-term and long term (provide link to document which I'll have to write).

### Team Formation and Project Planning
At our initial team meeting, we came together and formed an understanding to undertake this project as an Agile-scrum project, with two week sprints (starting Monday). (More to come at the meeting)
