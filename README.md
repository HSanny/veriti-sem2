## Project Overview
Veriti Fake News filtering project which aims to apply statistical machine learning and Artifical Intelligence algorithms to the problem of fake news. Veriti is a startup business which proposes a news display application which would show content from various news sources which have been filtered to remove fake news, giving the reader a level of confidence in the accuracy of the news along with a balance of news from multiple sources. The application will allow users to access news articles in text, audio and video form from around the world with the touch of a button. We will be leveraging AI to filter news for trustworthy, and interesting content which will provide users with value and help combat the titanic problem of Fake News in the Internet Age.

## Motivation
We are living in a time when fast access to reliable news sources is in higher demand than ever. Times of global crises bring the need for trustworthy news to the forefront.

## Clients Vision
Gone are the days of reading newspapers during a sunny Monday morning out on the front yard. With the ever-evolving help of technology, we seek to provide genuine, trustworthy and individually relevant news to customers at their fingertips. We are streamlining the news and turning it into an experience that is both interesting and efficient for the consumer. 

## Website for Veriti
We also created a website for our Veriti Project which contains overview and members of the project.
